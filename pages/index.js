          Thanks to my study background in international business and marketing
          psychology, I connect UX/UI design with real business goals, while
          providing delightful client experiences. Outside of my full-time
          commitments, I work with a select freelance client base to create
          amazing products and solutions. I am passionate about building and
          designing thoughtful experiences to make sure your customers and users
          are satisfied when they are using your products and services online. I
          also love documenting my journey and sharing it with the community to
          help others succeed and grow.
